# A Community made VALORANT Tournament Overlay
> This is made by the community and is not affiliated with Riot Games and/or VALORANT.

### The concept
We always wanted to have a real tournament overlay for community hosted events. As it seems like Riot only gives access to their "VCT Style" overlay to prominent groups (OfflineTV, AfreecaTV, ...) we tried to replicate the overlay as much as possible in the form of an HTML overlay and a Python App that hot-modifies the html markup in the files. As well as server data fetching should the user host game results and map picks on an offsite server.
