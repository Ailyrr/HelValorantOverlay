# A Community made VALORANT Tournament Overlay
> This is made by the community and is not affiliated with Riot Games and/or VALORANT.

### The concept
We always wanted to have a real tournament overlay for community hosted events. As it seems like Riot only gives access to their "VCT Style" overlay to prominent groups (OfflineTV, AfreecaTV, ...) we tried to replicate the overlay as much as possible in the form of an HTML overlay and a Python App that hot-modifies the html markup in the files. As well as server data fetching should the user host game results and map picks on an offsite server.

### Functionalites
This is a comprehensive list of all planned and currently working functionalities that this repository contains.

##### Local function (no need for server data)
- Custom Scoreboard Styling. (WIP)
- Custom map picks on top left of screen (Local done, server WIP)
- Custom Halftime and Timeout timers. (Done)
##### Server dependent functions
- Map pick overlay (Done)
- Map pick selector, admin only (WIP)
##### Misc functions
- Streamdeck compatibility (WIP)

### Examples

> Used to display which map is currently played and which one is up next. Works with either manual local data modification or with server data fetching.
